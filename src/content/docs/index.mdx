RLMatrix provides a comprehensive reinforcement learning framework for C# developers with performance exceeding Python alternatives.
## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Algorithm Library**: Includes PPO, DQN with all popular modifications (up to C51 and DQN Rainbow), GAIL, and more algorithms on the way
- **Revolutionary DRL Workflow**: Thanks to C# source generation in the toolkit, you can focus on your domain problem rather than wrestling with complex API requirements - simply add attributes to your code and the toolkit generates all the reinforcement learning plumbing automatically
- **Multi-Head Support**: Handle continuous, discrete, and mixed action spaces simultaneously in a single agent
- **RNN Integration**: Enable recurrent neural networks with a simple option toggle for handling sequential or partial observability problems
- **Pure C# Implementation**: Built entirely in C# with TorchSharp backend, providing native performance and complete type safety
- **Game Engine Ready**: Battle-tested in Unity and Godot.
- **Superior Performance**: Faster and more stable than Python's stable-baselines, ml-agents, and Godot RL agents
- **Multi-Environment Training**: Scale learning across parallel (optionally networked) environments
- **Industrial-Grade Distributed Training**: High-performance, fault-tolerant networked architecture ready for large-scale reinforcement learning deployments
- **Transparent Source Code**: Clean, well-documented codebase that's easy to extend or customize. Reinforcement Learning with Dependency Injection! 
- **Production Reliability**: Designed for stability in long-running training sessions with failure tolerance
